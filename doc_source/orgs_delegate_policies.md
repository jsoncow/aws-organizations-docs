# Delegated administrator for AWS Organizations<a name="orgs_delegate_policies"></a>

You can delegate policy management for AWS Organizations to specified member accounts to perform policy actions that are by default available only to the management account\. 

## Create or update a resource\-based delegation policy<a name="orgs-policy-delegate"></a>

From the management account, create or update a resource\-based delegation policy for your organization and add a statement that specifies which member accounts can perform actions on policies\. You can add multiple statements in the policy to denote a different set of permissions to member accounts\.

**Minimum permissions**  
To create or update the resource\-based delegation policy, you need permissions to run the following actions:  
`organizations:PutResourcePolicy`
`organizations:DescribeResourcePolicy` 
Additionally, you must grant roles and users in the delegated administrator account the corresponding IAM permissions to the required actions\. Without IAM permissions, it is assumed that the calling principal doesn’t have the required permissions to manage AWS Organizations policies\.

------
#### [ AWS Management Console ]

Add statements to the resource\-based delegation policy in the AWS Management Console using one of the following methods: 
+ **JSON policy** – Paste and customize an [example resource\-based delegation policy](orgs_manage_policies_delegate_examples.md) to use in your account, or type your own JSON policy document in the JSON editor\.
+ **Visual editor** – Construct a new delegation policy in the visual editor, which guides you in creating a delegation policy without having to write JSON syntax\.

**Use the JSON policy editor to create or update a delegation policy**

1. Sign in to the [AWS Organizations console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2)\. You must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user \([not recommended](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials)\) in the organization’s management account\.

1. Choose **Settings**\.

1. In the **Delegated administrator for AWS Organizations** section, choose **Delegate** to create the Organizations delegation policy\. To update an existing delegation policy, choose **Edit**\.

1. Type or paste a JSON policy document\. For details about the IAM policy language, see [IAM JSON policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html) reference\.

1. Resolve any [security warnings, errors, or general warnings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html) generated during policy validation, and then choose **Create policy** to save your work\.

**Use the visual editor to create or update a delegation policy**

1. Sign in to the [AWS Organizations console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2)\. You must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user \([not recommended](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials)\) in the organization’s management account\.

1. Choose **Settings**\.

1. In the **Delegated administrator for AWS Organizations** section, choose **Delegate** to create the Organizations delegation policy\. To update an existing delegation policy, choose **Edit**\.

1. On the **Create Delegation policy** page, choose **Add new statement**\.

1. Set **Effect** to `Allow`\.

1. Add `Principal` to define the member accounts to which you want to delegate\. For details about syntax, see the [Example resource\-based delegation policies](orgs_manage_policies_delegate_examples.md)\.

1. From the list of **Actions**, choose the actions you want to delegate\. You can use **Filter actions** to narrow down the choices\.

1. To specify if the delegated member account can attach policies to the organization root or organizational units \(OUs\), set `Resources`\. You must also select `policy` as a resource type\. For additional details, see the [Example resource\-based delegation policies](orgs_manage_policies_delegate_examples.md)\. You can specify resources in the following ways:
   + Choose **Add a resource** and construct the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) by following the prompts in the dialog box\.
   + List resource ARNs manually in the editor\. For more information about ARN syntax, see [Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the AWS General Reference Guide\. For information about using ARNs in the resource element of a policy, see [IAM JSON policy elements: Resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_resource.html)\.

1. Choose **Add a condition** to specify other conditions, including the policy type you want to delegate\. Choose the condition's **Condition key**, **Tag key**, **Qualifier**, and **Operator**, and then type a **Value**\. For additional details, see [Example resource\-based delegation policies](orgs_manage_policies_delegate_examples.md)\. When you're finished, choose **Add condition**\. For more information about the **Condition** element, see [IAM JSON policy elements: Condition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html) in the IAM JSON policy reference\.

1. To add more permission blocks, choose **Add new statement**\. For each block, repeat steps 5 through 9\.

1. Resolve any security warnings, errors, or general warnings generated during [policy validation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_policy-validator.html), and then choose **Create policy** to save your work\.
